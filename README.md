# Food-and-Beverages-Case-study
Food and beverages dataset statistical analysis

the “flavor” column in the Product Launch Dataset. Each product (as specified by a product ID) could come in
combination of multiple flavors. Ïf you eyeball some of entries in the column you will notice that there are
multiple terms strung together into a list to describe the flavor combination. Each unique flavor used in a 
product is separated from another by a semicolon (;). 

For instance, Product ID #10 carries the following list under the “flavor” column: 
Cherry, not specified; Vanilla, not specified 

You can infer that this product (#10) comes in combination of two unique flavors. The first flavor “Cherry, 
not specified” means the flavor is cherry but it is not mentioned what particular type of cherry flavor is 
used (e.g red or black). The second entry stands for vanilla but it is not mentioned what type of vanilla 
it is (e.g. French). 

Likewise, Product ID #8 lists the following in the “flavor” column:
Apple, Red; Pineapple; Guava 

This represents a combination of three unique flavors: red apple, pineapple and guava. 
If you look carefully at the data you will also notice a double pipe separator (||) in some entries. These
indicate product variants i.e. the same product launched with a new flavor. Think about how you would like
to deal with these product variants in your analysis for the client.
